# Hello there!👋 - Welcome to my GitHub Page!
I'm a Full-Stack Web Developer with 4+ years of experience turning coffee into code and fighting bugs.🐛 💻

## 👨‍💻 About Me:

**🎨 Frontend Fanatic:** Although I enjoy doing fullstack, I have to admit the frontend is where my creative brain runs wild 🐎. If it involves creative problem-solving and making things pretty, I'm all in.

**🧠 Lifelong Learner:** I'm always up for a challenge if there's a new technology out there, I'm probably breaking things with it already.

**🚀 Side Project Enthusiast:** After my 9-to-5 work, you'll find me hustling on personal projects. (Yes, my GitHub is a construction site🚧)

**📱 Latest Adventure:** Currently building an iOS mobile app using Swift because why not!... mobile development is my new current obsession! 🤷‍♂️
